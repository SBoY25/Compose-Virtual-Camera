# üé• Virtual Camera Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ **Fixed Issues:**
- ‚úÖ Video path sharing between Preview and Advanced screens
- ‚úÖ Camera app registration for external apps (TikTok, Telegram, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Proper camera intent handling
- ‚úÖ Global video path management
- ‚úÖ Full-screen video display for external apps
- ‚úÖ Tap-to-capture functionality

## üß™ **How to Test with External Apps:**

### **Step 1: Start Virtual Camera**
1. Open your Virtual Camera app
2. Go to **Preview** tab
3. Select a video file
4. Go to **Advanced** tab
5. Click **"Start Virtual Camera with Video"**
6. You should see: ‚úÖ **"Video selected: [filename]"**

### **Step 2: Test with TikTok**
1. Open TikTok
2. Tap the **"+"** button to create a video
3. Tap **"Camera"** or **"Record"**
4. Your virtual camera should appear with the selected video playing
5. Tap the screen to capture a photo/video

### **Step 3: Test with Telegram**
1. Open Telegram
2. Start a chat
3. Tap the **camera icon** or **attachment button**
4. Select **"Camera"**
5. Your virtual camera should appear with the selected video

### **Step 4: Test with Other Apps**
- **Instagram**: Stories ‚Üí Camera
- **WhatsApp**: Chat ‚Üí Camera icon
- **Snapchat**: Camera screen
- **Any camera app** that uses `ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE` or `ACTION_VIDEO_CAPTURE`

## üîß **Technical Details:**

### **What Was Fixed:**
1. **VideoPathManager**: Global video path storage using SharedPreferences
2. **Camera Intent Detection**: Detects when launched by external apps
3. **Full-Screen Mode**: Hides UI for external apps, shows only video
4. **Tap-to-Capture**: Tap anywhere on video to capture
5. **Proper Result Handling**: Returns proper data URIs to calling apps

### **Key Files Modified:**
- `VideoPathManager.kt` - Global video path management
- `VirtualCameraActivity.kt` - Enhanced camera interface
- `SystemVirtualCamera.kt` - Video path persistence
- `activity_virtual_camera.xml` - Added camera controls ID

## üêõ **Troubleshooting:**

### **If External Apps Don't See Virtual Camera:**
1. Check if app is installed as system app (Advanced tab)
2. Verify camera permissions are granted
3. Restart the virtual camera service
4. Check logs: `adb logcat | grep VirtualCamera`

### **If Video Doesn't Play:**
1. Ensure video file is valid and accessible
2. Check video path in logs
3. Try with a different video file
4. Verify video format is supported (MP4 recommended)

### **If Capture Doesn't Work:**
1. Tap directly on the video area
2. Check if calling app expects specific data format
3. Verify camera permissions

## üì± **Expected Behavior:**

### **Inside Your App:**
- Preview shows selected video
- Advanced screen shows video selection status
- Button text changes based on video selection

### **In External Apps:**
- Full-screen video display (no UI controls)
- Tap anywhere to capture
- Proper return to calling app
- Video plays continuously in background

## üéØ **Success Indicators:**
- ‚úÖ External apps launch your virtual camera
- ‚úÖ Selected video plays in full screen
- ‚úÖ Tap-to-capture works
- ‚úÖ Apps receive proper photo/video data
- ‚úÖ No "test pattern" message when video is selected

---

**Note**: The virtual camera now works as a proper camera app that other applications can use. The selected video will play instead of the test pattern, and external apps will see a full-screen video interface with tap-to-capture functionality.
